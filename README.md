A Flutter project with Two Stylish Card View.

## Getting Started

A Flutter project with Two Stylish Card View is a mobile application user interface design that utilizes the Flutter framework. 
The main feature of the application is two card views that are both visually appealing and functional. 
The cards are designed to display important information in an organized and easy-to-read format. 
The first card view displays details about a product or service, including an image, title, description, and price. 
The second card view showcases a list of related products or services, allowing users to easily navigate and explore additional options. 
Both card views are designed with modern and stylish aesthetics, incorporating bold typography and eye-catching graphics. 
This Flutter project provides a great example of how Flutter can be used to create beautiful and functional user interfaces for mobile applications.
